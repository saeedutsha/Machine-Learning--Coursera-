# Machine Learning (Coursera)
This is my solution to all the programming assignments of Machine-Learning (Coursera) taught by Andrew Ng. For getting a broad idea of machine learning algorithms, this course is greatly helpful.
Please try to solve all the assignments by yourself first, but if you get stuck somewhere or comapare your code then feel free to browse the code.
